# Abstraction

"""
1. - Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
   - Achieved using abstract classes and abstract methods.
   - Prevents object instantiation of abstract classes.
   - Must be implemented by child classes.

Example:  
Consider a `Shape` class, which has a `calculate_area()` method.  
We donâ€™t define how the area is calculated but ensure that every specific shape (like Circle, Rectangle, or Triangle)
must provide its own implementation.
