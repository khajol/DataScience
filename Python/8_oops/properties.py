OOPS Properties

1. Inheritance: It allows a class (child) to acquire properties and behaviors from another class (parent). 
                It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between different classes.
                Example: A car inherits general properties from the vehicle class (like having wheels, an engine, and the ability to move). 
                         A sports car can extend this further with additional features like turbo mode.

2. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means "many forms." 
                 It allows methods or functions to perform differently based on the object calling them. 
                 It enables flexibility and scalability in a program.
                 Example: Consider a printer. A laser printer and an inkjet printer both have a print function, 
                          but they execute printing differently based on their mechanism.

3. Encapsulation: It restricts direct access to certain details of an object and only exposes the necessary parts. 
                  It protects data from unintended modifications.
                  Example: A bank account has a balance that cannot be modified directly. 
                           Instead, you can deposit or withdraw money through secure transactions.

4. Abstraction: It hides unnecessary details and only exposes the essential functionalities to the user. 
                It simplifies complex systems.
                Example: When using a mobile phone, you interact with apps through a simple interface. 
                         You donâ€™t need to understand the complex backend processes like how the OS manages memory or how network signals work.
