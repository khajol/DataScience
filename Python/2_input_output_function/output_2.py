# Defining variables for the company name and location
company_name = 'Luminar Technolab'
location = 'Kakkanad'

# Print the values of the variables directly
print(company_name)  
print(location)  

# If the variable passing is incorrect (e.g., if the variable is not defined), Python will show an error
# For example, if you try to print a variable that does not exist like this:
# print(non_existing_variable)  # This will raise a NameError

# Print variables with a statement
print("Institution name is", company_name)  # Concatenates the text and variable
print("Institution located at", location)  

# You can also combine multiple variables and strings in one print statement
print(company_name, "is an IT finishing school located at", location)  # Output with multiple variables in a single print
