# Input and Output Functions in Python


# Output Function - To print a message in the console (where a program shows its output)
# In Python, the function used for output is 'print()'
# The 'print()' function outputs the value or message passed to it in the console.

# Example of Output:
print("Hello, world!")  # This will print "Hello, world!" in the console

# Other programming languages may have different functions for output:
# - C uses printf()
# - C++ uses cout
# - JavaScript uses console.log()


# Input Function - To read a value from the console from a user
# In Python, the 'input()' function is used to take input from the user.
# The input received from the user is typically stored as a string.

# Example of Input:
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")  # The input function waits for the user to enter a value
print(f"Hello, {user_name}!")  # Outputs the entered name

# Other programming languages may have different functions for input:
# - C uses scanf()
# - C++ uses cin
# - JavaScript uses prompt()
