Flow controls in programming manage the sequence in which statements are executed.

3 types of Flow controls:
 1. Decision-making: Allows the program to choose different paths based on conditions using if, else, or elif statements.
 2. Looping: Repeats a block of code multiple times using loops like for and while.
 3. Jumping: Alters the flow by jumping to different parts of the code using statements like break, continue, and return.
