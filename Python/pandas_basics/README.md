# Pandas Basics

Welcome to the **PandasBasics** folder! This section covers the fundamental concepts of **Pandas**, a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. Pandas is widely used in data science and analytics for handling structured data.

## What is Pandas?
Pandas is an open-source Python library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures like **Series** and **DataFrame**. It is essential for tasks involving data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

## Topics Covered
- **Pandas Introduction** – Understanding the basics of Pandas
- **Installation & Setup** – Installing Pandas and setting up the environment
- **Pandas Data Structures** – Understanding Series and DataFrame
- **Data Loading** – Reading data from different formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.)
- **Data Selection & Indexing** – Accessing specific rows, columns, or subsets of data
- **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing data, duplicates, and transformations
- **Data Aggregation** – Grouping and aggregating data
- **Merging & Joining** – Combining datasets
- **Data Visualization** – Basic plotting with Pandas
- **Performance Optimization** – Using Pandas efficiently for large datasets

## Getting Started
To use Pandas, install it using pip if you haven’t already:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

Then, import it in your Python script:
```python
import pandas as pd
```

## Example Usage
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob'], 'age': [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

# Perform an operation: Add 1 to each age
df['age'] = df['age'] + 1
print(df)
print(a * 2)  # Multiply each element by 2
```

## Notes
- Pandas provides powerful tools for data manipulation, allowing you to work with tabular data efficiently.
- It’s built on top of NumPy and integrates well with other libraries like Matplotlib for visualization and Scikit-learn for machine learning.
- Mastering Pandas will greatly enhance your data processing and analysis skills.
