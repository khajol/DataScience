# NumPy Basics

Welcome to the **NumPyBasics** folder! This section covers the fundamental concepts of NumPy, a powerful numerical computing library in Python. NumPy is essential for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

## What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library used for numerical computations in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.

## Topics Covered
- **NumPy Introduction** – Understanding the basics of NumPy
- **Installation & Setup** – Installing NumPy and setting up the environment
- **NumPy Arrays** – Creating and manipulating arrays
- **Array Operations** – Mathematical and statistical operations
- **Indexing & Slicing** – Accessing elements in arrays
- **Broadcasting** – Operations on arrays of different shapes
- **Linear Algebra** – Matrix operations, dot products, and more
- **Random Module** – Generating random numbers
- **Performance Optimization** – Using NumPy for faster computations

## Getting Started
To use NumPy, install it using pip if you haven’t already:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

Then, import it in your Python script:
```python
import numpy as np
```

## Example Usage
```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(a)

# Perform an operation
print(a * 2)  # Multiply each element by 2
```

## Notes
- NumPy is the foundation for other libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
- Understanding NumPy will help you work efficiently with large datasets.
