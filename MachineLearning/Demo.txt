Machine Learning
Overview
Machine Learning (ML) is about teaching a machine to recognize patterns from data, and then make predictions or decisions based on that data. It's a branch of artificial intelligence that involves training a model to learn from data rather than following pre-programmed rules.

Types of Programming
1) Traditional Programming
In traditional programming, humans write rules that a computer follows to produce results.

Input --> Logic (Rules) --> Output
Example: To calculate the area of a rectangle, input the length and width, and use the formula: Area = Length * Width

2) Machine Learning Programming
In Machine Learning programming, the machine learns rules from data.

Input (Data) --> Logic (Learned from data) --> Output
Example: To predict the area of a rectangle, input the length and width, and the model learns the rule from data to predict new areas.

Types of Machine Learning
1) Supervised Learning
The machine learns from labeled data (data with inputs and outputs).
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Applications: Spam filtering, medical diagnosis, fraud detection.
2) Unsupervised Learning
The machine learns patterns from unlabeled data (only inputs without outputs).
Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Applications: Market segmentation, anomaly detection.
3) Semi-Supervised Learning
Combines labeled and unlabeled data for training.
Applications: Text and image recognition.
4) Reinforcement Learning
The machine learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties).
Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks.
Applications: Game playing, robotics, resource management.
Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning involves training a model with labeled data. The data includes both input features and corresponding output labels.

Types of Supervised Learning
1) Classification
Used to predict categorical outcomes (e.g., spam or not spam).
Examples: Email filtering, disease prediction.
Algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes.
2) Regression
Used to predict continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature).
Examples: Predicting house prices, forecasting stock prices.
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning involves finding patterns in data without labeled outputs.

Types of Unsupervised Learning
1) Clustering
Groups data points based on similarity.
Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models.
Applications: Market segmentation, customer profiling.
Data Collection Methods
There are several ways to collect data for machine learning models.

1) APIs
Example: Twitter API to collect tweets.
Advantages: Structured data, easy access.
Limitations: Rate limits, API key requirements.
2) Web Scraping
Collecting data from websites directly using tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.
Advantages: Access to non-API data.
Limitations: Legal and ethical issues, website structure changes.
3) Webhooks
Real-time data collection where platforms push updates to your system.
Example: GitHub Webhooks to track commits.
4) Public Datasets
Examples: Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, World Bank Data.
Advantages: Free, reliable.
Limitations: Preprocessing may be required.
Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that detects whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Applications: Customer feedback analysis, market research, brand monitoring.

Process:

Collect reviews using APIs (e.g., Twitter, Facebook).
Analyze the sentiment using machine learning models.
Output the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
Tools: Use Python libraries like TextBlob, VADER, or Transformers for sentiment analysis.

Steps in Machine Learning
1) Data Collection
Gather data from various sources such as APIs, web scraping, and public datasets.

2) Data Preparation and Exploration
Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers.
Explore the data through statistics and visualizations.
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
3) Model Creation
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, SVM).
Train the model using training data.
4) Performance Evaluation
Evaluate the model using test data and metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

5) Model Improvements
Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters, modifying features, and using advanced techniques like ensemble methods.

Training and Testing Data
Training Data: Data used to train the model and help it learn patterns.
Testing Data: Data used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on unseen examples.
Common Data Split Ratios:

70% training, 30% testing
80% training, 20% testing
